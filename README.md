# LIN 177 Final Project
Jerry Wu

Section A03

## Introduction
For the final project, I am expanding on the `japanese.swipl` program from Homework 1. Here, I am exploring some (but not all) verb conjugations. The main form I am looking at is the indicative form, with a little bit of the progressive form as extra.

In the original `japanese.swipl`, we had:

> _Adamu ga waraimasu._\
> Adam laughs.

For this assignment, we just declared _waraimasu_ as the verb, but it stems from the root word _warau_.
Much like in English, we can say "Adam laughs" to show present tense, and "Adam laughed" in past tense.
Japanese also does this by modifying the root word and doing a suffixation.
In the case of _warau_, _u_ is dropped and _imasu_ is added to the end.
Here is another set of examples:

> _Adamu wa waraimasu._ Adam laughs.\
> _Adamu wa waraimashita._ Adam laughed.\
> _Adamu wa waraimasen._ Adam won't laugh.\
> _Adamu wa waraimasendeshita._ Adam did not laugh.\
> _Adamu wa waratteimasu._ Adam is laughing.
